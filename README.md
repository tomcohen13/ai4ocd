A funny app I developed to help combatting undesirable OCD behavior.

The app uses multi-modal LLMs and webcam access to detect behavior as it occurs and notifies the user whenever they engage in it.

<!-- Examples:  -->

<!-- 1. Not touching ![Alt text](/resources/images/screenshot-not-touching.png?raw=true "Not Touching")

2. Touching alert ![Alt text](/resources/images/screenshot-touching.png?raw=true "Touching") -->
