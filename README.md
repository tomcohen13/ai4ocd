# Can't Touch This!
Excessive stress got me touching my hair often and compulsively. So, I wrote an app to help me fix it.
The app uses the computer's camera and an AI model I trained to alert me whenever I touch my hair.
For the website, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For the AI/CV portion, I lazily trained a model on Azure CustomVision with data I generated and used its API to make predictions on the fly.

Example: 

1. Not touching ![Alt text](/resources/images/screenshot-not-touching.png?raw=true "Not Touching")

2. Touching alert ![Alt text](/resources/images/screenshot-touching.png?raw=true "Touching")
